## Introduction to Data science
In this topic, I used conda from anaconda to activate a virtual environment, using the commmand 
```bash
   conda create -p venv python==3.18
```
I also learnt how to create an file for a use, using the suffix 
``` bash
ipynb
```
Once I activated the debugger using the command
```bash
pip install ipykernel
```
I ran some python codes and the outputs were correct
